> Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. The app that you will create will allow you to:
 >- Add new students or teachers.
 >- Add new books.
 >- Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.

>And all of this will be built in a beautiful and well-organized way!
